# Lightkurve
Exoplanet data analysis using data from TESS mission

Here I will upload jupyter notebooks that I use to analyze exoplanet data. 

My goal is to help others learn the Lightkurve package, starting from target pixel files,all the way to lightcurve folding and binning to end with the basic calculations of the physical properties. 

***Also, the Jupyter notebooks that I upload are legal copyrights if I make a new exoplanet discovery.***

Feel free to share the knowledge and use my Jupyter notebooks. You can contact me at: gxlekkas@gmail.com and I will be more than happy to help you with all the knowledge I have. 
Enjoy and happy hunting.
